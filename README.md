# Resilient_Reefs_2024

This repository hosts the configuration files for UCLA-ROMS that were used to simulate the oceanographic state near Raja Ampat for years 2019-2020, 2021-2022, and 2070-2071 as part of The Nature Conservancy's Resilient Reefs project.  Note that input datasets that were used to force these simulations are hosted elsewhere.
